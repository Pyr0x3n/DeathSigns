DeathSigns
==========

DeathSigns add-on for Libs Hungergames. Add a death sign when a player is killed

This plugin require Lib's Hungergames installed on your server.

Tested with spigot 1.7.9 #1463 , Lib's Hungergames 5.4.2

Place a death sign on the spot of a murdered player.... Thats it!

Created this plugin for fun after this post:

Pretty useless (and annoying?).... but maybe someone need it!
